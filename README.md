Grade- Exceeds Expectations

Reviewer comments-

Excellent work! Your code exceeds expectations and even goes above. From your project, I see great efforts from a techdegree student seeking exceeds expectations. I especially like your code comments which is by far one of the most concise and complete among all the projects I have participated in reviewing. In addition, animations you added to your form makes user experience better. Some personal suggestions I can make is that:

-You have declared some unused variables inside your callback funciton from line 431 to line 441.
-You could make some functions to refactor your code to 'DRY' your code a bit.

Overall, excellent job on this project. Can't wait to see your next project to inspire me.
